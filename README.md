# hello-world-react
A simple hello world react example with a component

To get around same origin errors in chrome because I am linking to online versions of react, react-dom and babel, I use http-server available in npm and create a server pointing to the top level folder of the repo.

Then just browse to <servername>/helloworld.html in your browser of choice.
